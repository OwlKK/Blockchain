Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Adaptive Stake (PoAS)

---HYBRID---
Participants must stake cryptocurrency to qualify for block validation and complete small,
computationally efficient puzzles to enhance security

---SECURITY SCALING---
The complexity of the PoW element adjusts dynamically based on the networkâ€™s perceived security risk,
e.g., higher activity during suspected attacks

---HIGH LEVEL ALGO---
    ---INIT---
    Validators are selected proportionally to their stake
    All validators complete a lightweight computational puzzle

    ---BLOCK VALIDATION---
    Validator stakes cryptocurrency as collateral
    Completes a minimal computational task whose difficulty depends on network risk metrics

    ---REWARD ALLOCATION---
    Validators are rewarded based on their stakes, contribution to computational tasks,
    and the accuracy of their validation

    ---RISK MONITORING---
    Anomaly detection algorithms monitor network behavior for signs of malicious activity
    In case of a detected attack, the PoW difficulty for validators is temporarily increased to deter exploitation

    ---CONSENSUS---
    The validated block is finalized through collective agreement by staked participants,
    prioritizing those who complete their tasks correctly

---BENEFITS---
Energy Efficiency
    - Reduces energy consumption by using lightweight puzzles and prioritizing staking over mining
    - Scalling difficulty to reduce energy consumption

Enhanced Security
    - Adaptive PoW increases resistance to attacks during high-risk periods

Decentralisation

Sustainability
    Operates with significantly lower energy requirements than traditional PoW systems
    while maintaining attack resistance
