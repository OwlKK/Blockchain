1. Attack Process:
Control of the Network's Consensus Mechanism:

    Proof of Work (PoW):
                         In PoW-based blockchains like Bitcoin, miners use computational power to solve complex
                         mathematical puzzles. The attacker would need to control more than 50% of the total
                         mining power (hash rate) to dominate the network. This allows them to:

                         Create an alternative chain:
                            The attacker can create a longer chain by mining faster than the rest of the network,
                            as the PoW protocol always favors the longest chain.

                         Double spending:
                            The attacker could potentially reverse transactions and double-spend coins
                            by creating a new chain that excludes the previous transactions, rendering them invalid.

    Proof of Stake (PoS):
                        In PoS-based blockchains like Ethereum (after its switch from PoW to PoS),
                        validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and
                        are willing to "stake." An attacker would need to control more than 50% of the staked
                        cryptocurrency in the network to:
                                Censor transactions:
                                    By controlling the majority of staking power, the attacker could
                                    prevent other validators from adding blocks or processing transactions.

                                Revert transactions:
                                    Similar to PoW, they could create an alternate chain,
                                    leading to double-spending or reversion of transactions.

The Attack Sequence:

    The attacker begins by gaining control of the majority of mining power (PoW) or staked tokens (PoS).
    They then either:
        Start mining an alternative chain with conflicting transactions (in PoW), or
        Prevent legitimate transactions and blocks from being validated (in PoS).
    After a while, the attacker's chain becomes the longest or most accepted,
    forcing the network to accept their version of the blockchain.

Consequences:
